Just got a mail from Cisco regarding a bug in the Linux kernel making some processes on the VCS go haywire and create a heavy CPU load on the box.

The fix is currently to boot the VCS.

The supposed bug is discussed here:Â <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/403732/anyone-else-experiencing-high-rates-of-linux-server-crashes-today">http://serverfault.com/questions/403732/anyone-else-experiencing-high-rates-of-linux-server-crashes-today</a>
