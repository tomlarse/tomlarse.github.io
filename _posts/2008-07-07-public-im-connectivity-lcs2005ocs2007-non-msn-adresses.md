# Public IM Connectivity LCS2005/OCS2007 non-msn adresses

If you are adding a contact in MOC that does not have msn.com/hotmail.com e-mail addresses, you need to write them in the format **address(domain.com)@msn.com** to add them correctly to the list. The reason seems to be that you are not federated to anything other than msn.com/hotmail.com.  
  
If the person with a non-msn account adds you, everything works fine.
