Seems there is a bug in OCS 2007 R2 that makes the edge server behave strangely. You will fail validation, and you might also get a "Limited External calling" message in the OC client.<br /><br />The solution is posted here:<br /><br /><a href="http://unified-communications.blogspot.com/2009/01/ocs-2007-r2-and-localization.html">http://unified-communications.blogspot.com/2009/01/ocs-2007-r2-and-localization.html</a>
