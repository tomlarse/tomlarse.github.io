After a bit of chasing around San Diego last week during <a href="http://www.lyncconf.com">Lyncconf13</a>, I was able to get a hold of a 128GB <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-8-pro/home">Surface Pro</a> at the Best Buy in Fashion Valley, and I absolutely love it so far.  The screen is very good and responsive and the Pen is the best stylus I have tried so far. Makes taking notes in OneNote a blast!

But one of the small things that has bugged me a bit is that some desktop programs seem a bit fuzzy, like for instance Spotify and Chrome (Everyone needs a second browser right?) Some of them are also hard to use with your fingers, I had to use the Pen in Chrome for instance. This happens because the Surface is by default set to scale the desktop to 125%, and those apps aren't handling that. (I've seen that some say the surface is scaled to 150%, but mine was/is not. The result should be the same though)

You can resolve this by telling windows not to scale those programs, like I've shown below. (Spotify screens are thumbnailed, click them to se full size.)

I'll be going back to playing with my Surface now!
