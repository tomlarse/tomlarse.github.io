# Surface Pro and scaling and fuzzy looking desktop apps

After a bit of chasing around San Diego last week during [Lyncconf13](http://www.lyncconf.com), I was able to get a hold of a 128GB [Surface Pro](http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/surface-with-windows-8-pro/home) at the Best Buy in Fashion Valley, and I absolutely love it so far. The screen is very good and responsive and the Pen is the best stylus I have tried so far. Makes taking notes in OneNote a blast!
