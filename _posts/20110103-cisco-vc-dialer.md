# Cisco VC Dialer

Getting my new iPad this weekend, I got to try the Cisco (Tandberg) VC Dialer from [Sping BV](http://www.visionsconnected.com/vcdialer) on some of my endpoints. It seems to be working perfectly! It is basically an app that can dial any number from any MXP, C, EX or E series endpoint. You can get it from the AppStore, search for VC Dialer (it is an iPhone app originally). The app is free for a limited number of downloads, after which it will be priced â‚¬4.99
