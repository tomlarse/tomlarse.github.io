**[Greg S (@TheRealGreg_S)](#4152 "2015-09-29 17:44:19"):** I had the same problem with Palo Alto as well for my edge connected users. We had to completely move way from the application based and use rules based. the app sharing was failing just like you mentioned. Good to know that Palo Alto is going to fix it. thanks for the additional info.

**[Brian](#4175 "2015-10-06 17:29:46"):** Hello, would you be willing to provide the Palo Alto ticket number so that I can provide it to the Support Engineer that we are working with? They have not been able to locate any information referencing the bug. We have had the workaround in place for sometime now and are still experiencing this issue.

**[E](#5189 "2018-01-25 19:29:29"):** Was this ever resolved with Palo Alto?

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#5190 "2018-01-25 20:09:49"):** As far as I know it is still an issue.

**[Peter Bollen](#4278 "2015-10-28 14:51:31"):** Have you tested if it is fixed in 7.0.3 ?

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#4279 "2015-10-28 14:56:05"):** Hi

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#4179 "2015-10-07 07:46:54"):** Mail me tom at codesalot.com

**[Eric](#5191 "2018-01-25 21:11:29"):** Thanks.

**[Peppy Woll](#4467 "2015-12-02 21:20:32"):** Thanks so much. This article saved me. Been troubleshooting a Federation desktop sharing issue for weeks. Implemented your suggestion and voila! I had searched for such a solution on the PAN Community and I find nothing. Could you post this on the PAN Community site, or allow me to? It would make it SO much more accessible to others having the same problem.
