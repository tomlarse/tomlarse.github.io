If you need to reboot a Skype for Business server, you might not always want the services to start automatically afterwords for various reasons. For instance if you are doing a shutdown of an entire pool, you'd want to run
´´´Start-CsPool -PoolFqdn skypepool.contoso.com´´´
to do a cold start of the pool, instead of the services starting automatically.

Use these oneliners to set the services to manual startup and back again to automatic afterwords.
