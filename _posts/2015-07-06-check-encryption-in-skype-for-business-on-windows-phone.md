Skype for Business has arrived on Windows Phone! The Lync 2013 app has recieved an update, and should already be rolled out to your phone - at least if you have automatic updates on. If not or if it hasn't updated automatically, you can get the update <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype-for-business/d85d8a57-0f61-4ff3-a0f4-444e131d8491" target="_blank">here</a>.

One of the new features included in the client is that now all data stored locally on the phone - like recent conversations, voice mails, pictures and user settings - is now encrypted.

In some cases this encryption doesn't get enabled in the update, so be sure to check <strong>Settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>about</strong> in your app to see if encryption is on. If it isn't, you need to uninstall the app and reinstall it again and it should be turned on.
