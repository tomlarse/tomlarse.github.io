Help! I'm trying to install Windows 8.1 preview, but the store page looks like someone is hacking me! Like this:

<a href="http://codesalot.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screenshot-8.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-510" alt="Screenshot (8)" src="http://codesalot.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screenshot-8.png?w=625" width="625" height="351" /></a>

Fear not, this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolocalization">Pseudolocalization</a>Â and happens because Store is not yet available in your language locale. This locale is tied to your Microsoft Account profile, not your OS language.
