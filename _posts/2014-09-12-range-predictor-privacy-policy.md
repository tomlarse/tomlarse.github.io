Range Predictor needs internet access and your location data to be able to show your position in a map. It uses the internet to download map tiles from Bing Maps when you zoom in or out of the map. No information about you is recorded in the app.

The app uses Microsoft Bing Maps to render the map, their privacy policy can be accessed <a title="here" href="http://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement/en-us/bing/default.aspx" target="_blank">here.</a>
