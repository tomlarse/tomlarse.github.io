# Cisco Meeting Server powershell module v0.4

So the Acano server got released in version 2 almost two months ago, and with that changed name to Cisco Meeting Server as a result of the Cisco aquisition. The PsAcano powershell module of course needed a name change as well, so the module is now called PsCms.
