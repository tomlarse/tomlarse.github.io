Just figured out that it is possible to blog directly from word via the xmlrpc.php script!

To enable it, you have to allow it in Wordpress itself

Settings -&gt; Writing -&gt; Remote Publishing

If you don't do this, Word will give you a <strong>"Word Cannot Register Your Account" </strong>error.

Thanks <a href="http://thebalancequest.com/blogging/wordpress-settings-%E2%80%9Cword-cannot-register-your-account%E2%80%9D-error">http://thebalancequest.com/blogging/wordpress-settings-%E2%80%9Cword-cannot-register-your-account%E2%80%9D-error</a> for the tip! I did not sit all night thanks to you :P

In word, just press new and "blog post", and word will help you set it up.

Now for the resultâ€¦ Edit: Success!
