Finally codesalot.com has been transfered to a new registrar! My blog http://unifiedcom.blogspot.com has been moved here, and has gotten a facelift. I will continue to post thoughts around videoconferencing and unified communications on this site from now on.

So welcome to a new and improved codesalot.com/unifiedcom. Enjoy and have fun.

BTW, the server is hosted by <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/new?referrer=7f9e33de7bfa48638ffdb67dde436bac" target="_blank">slicehost.com</a>. Check them out!
