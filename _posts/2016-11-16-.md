Everyone who works with IT has a set of basic tools troubleshooting and information collection tools that we use more or less daily, for instance:
<ul>
	<li>A tool to check network connectivity and response times</li>
	<li>A tool to connect to and verify network services</li>
	<li>A tool to resolve DNS names</li>
	<li>A tool to clear local DNS cache</li>
	<li>A tool to view local network configuration</li>
</ul>
And so on. These tools more often then not vary from platform to platform, but they do the same basic tasks. Some of them are even more or less universal, like 'ping' for instance which we all know.

However, with Powershell now being open source and also such a deeply integrated feature in Windows operating systems, it is now time to move out of the old days and in to the future! In this blogpost I've collected a set of the most common basic IT tools and show the equivalent powershell cmdlet.
