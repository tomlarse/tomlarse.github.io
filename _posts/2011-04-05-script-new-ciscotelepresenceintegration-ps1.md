# Script - New-CiscoTelepresenceIntegration.ps1

Script to enable routes from Lync to VCS Control: ---- Edit: After the VCS X7 release, the integration is done a bit differently. I'll try to get an update to the script out in the near future.

**[leonskee](#60 "2011-08-25 14:59:46"):** I'm working in a OCS/Lync coexistance environment. Is this script intended for use after a merge topology has taken place?
