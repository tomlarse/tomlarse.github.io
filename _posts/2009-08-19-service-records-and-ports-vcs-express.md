**[Jason](#8 "2011-04-18 12:15:45"):** For clustering, does a new entry needs to be added on the DNS or can one of the above be used? Thanks!

**[tom](#9 "2011-04-29 08:40:43"):** Hi

**[Kuhuna](#10 "2011-05-09 22:31:27"):** Can SRV Records be used for subdomains?

**[tom](#11 "2011-05-10 08:52:43"):** Hi!

**[Mads](#12 "2011-07-18 14:27:23"):** Is it best practise to use different SIP domains when integrating Tandberg VCS with Lync?

**[tom](#13 "2011-07-19 14:24:38"):** It's not only best practice, it's more or less required. There are always problems in the installations i've seen when the same sipdomain is used.
