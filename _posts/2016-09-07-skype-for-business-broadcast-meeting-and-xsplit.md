I got a question about a blogpost I made about Skype for Business Broadcast Meetings and Xsplit and realised that it had been quite som time since I tested this myself. This video is me chatting while testing what could be done.

Every time I get audio through my own speakers the sound degrades quite a bit, sorry about that. It is especially noticeable at the end when I'm playing with the Chrome web app.

I also did not get the audio from the video I played, I'll try messing around with audio settings to see how it can be done.

If anyone wants to see the broadcast meeting itself, it is available here, although I don't know for how long.
