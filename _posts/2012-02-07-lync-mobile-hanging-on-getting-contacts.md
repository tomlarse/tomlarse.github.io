# #Lync mobile hanging on 

I have just been troubleshooting a weird issue where a user complained about Lync mobile taking a long time signing in, and then not showing the buddy list until several days after sign in. Push would also not work until after the contact list was downloaded.

**[Kevin](#131 "2012-09-07 04:40:58"):** thanks for highlighting this. just a note in case you haven't tried, this seems to affect only ipad/iphone lync mobile client apps. we tested same user (had a couple of vcx contacts in his contact list) on the android app and he didn't show this issue, logged in right away with android.

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#253 "2013-06-21 08:46:51"):** Glad to be of any help. It's a bit annoying that this is still an issue though...
