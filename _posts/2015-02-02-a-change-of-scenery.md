After eight years at Atea the time has come for a change of scenery. As of today me and <a href="http://msitpros.com/?author=5" target="_blank">Christian Knarvik</a> start a new adventure at <a href="http://knowledgefactory.com/" target="_blank">Knowledge Factory</a> where we will bring KF to southern Norway. I am really looking forward to starting work with bringing Skype for Business to Norway together with KF.

I want to thank my colleagues in Atea for the last eight years - and to my new colleagues inÂ KF, I can't wait to get to know you all!
