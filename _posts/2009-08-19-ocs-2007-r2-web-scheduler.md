The OCS 2007 R2 Web scheduler is now available

<em>"Web Scheduler is a 64-bit tool for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2. It provides a Web-based alternative to the add-in for the Microsoft Outlook messaging and collaboration client for the purpose of scheduling a meeting using Office Communications Server 2007 R2. It also provides a browser-based conference management experience that includes operations such as:</em>

<em> </em>

<em><span> </span></em>
<ul>
	<li><em>Scheduling a new Live Meeting conference or conference call.</em></li>
	<li><em>Viewing and modifying details of an existing conference.</em></li>
	<li><em>Listing all existing user schedules of a Microsoft Office conference.</em></li>
	<li><em>Deleting an existing conference.</em></li>
	<li><em>Sending an e-mail invitation to conference participants by using a configured SMTP mail server.</em></li>
	<li><em>Joining an existing conference."</em></li>
</ul>
<em></em>
I need to lab it before I can say anything about it, but it seems like a great addition to the family! Needs to be installed on the same IIS server as the OCS 2007 R2 web components.
