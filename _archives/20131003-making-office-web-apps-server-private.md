# Making Office Web Apps Server private

After installing the WAC server following [this](http://ucdaily.net/2013/01/16/installing-the-office-web-apps-server-for-lync-server-2013/) or another guide, we also normally publish the WAC server through the same reverse proxy method as we do the other Lync web services - using the DNS name that we configured when we created the farm.
