# Producing Skype Meeting Broadcast for webinars and webcasts

The last couple of months Skype Meeting Broadcast has been available in technical preview and we've been testing it as a platform to deliver webinars and webcasts on a couple of occations. This post is a writeup on our experiences from this.

## Comments

**[Robert M.](#5049 "2017-07-06 12:08:08"):** How can I capture an attendee list? I would like to set up a register for an event on our wordpress site.

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#5050 "2017-07-07 07:21:49"):** This is something that is really missing from Broadcast Meeting so far. There is also no way to see who has joined until after the meeting, and even then it is anonymous and needs to be extracted from a csv.

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#5004 "2017-04-06 21:07:12"):** If it is a hybrid environment, be sure to set up correct hosting providers and federated domains

**[Andrew](#4999 "2017-03-27 18:16:36"):** In anonymous mode, is it possible to track who attended the broadcast?

**[jim basa](#5003 "2017-04-06 20:58:29"):** I can't seem to connect as we test this. We are enabled for it on our O365Tenant. So what could I be missing?

**[jim basa](#5005 "2017-04-06 21:08:43"):** Thanks. It is online only. I was hoping to do a test before a meeting in a few weeks. Can't understand why I cant connect/join.

**[Tom-Inge Larsen](#5002 "2017-04-06 20:25:10"):** No, unfortunately not.
