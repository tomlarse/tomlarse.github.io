# Playing with PS: Script: Start remote Lync management session

I wrote a script to start a remote Lync management shell session based on [this](http://blogs.technet.com/b/csps/archive/2010/06/16/qsremoteaccess.aspx) post. This of course is a big bloated way to do it (it can be done as a [twoliner](http://blog.powershell.no/2010/12/05/lync-server-2010-remote-administration/)), but I need the PS training :P
