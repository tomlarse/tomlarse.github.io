# Skype for Business meeting join not starting in Google Chrome

Today I got to troubleshoot this little curiosity. A customer that uses Google Chrome as their standard browser reported that a few of their users wasn't able to join meetings when clicking the meeting join link, nothing happens and they are displayed a page looking like this.

**[Luca Vitali](#4219 "2015-10-16 06:07:59"):** Hi, thank you for this helpful article. The concerns about different browsers with Web App are many, and in my experience they are the most dangerous for the product acceptance. This issue typically occurs to VIP, CxO, Boss etc., and the common comment is: this product (Lync/Skype4B) sucks! Very frustrating for us that try to spread the product across customers....

**[Gunjan](#4717 "2016-02-10 14:49:37"):** I ran into the same issue. I did find in "Protocol_handler" in “Local State” but I am not able to find "lync15" in it. Please help.
