# Check encryption in Skype for Business on Windows Phone

Skype for Business has arrived on Windows Phone! The Lync 2013 app has recieved an update, and should already be rolled out to your phone - at least if you have automatic updates on. If not or if it hasn't updated automatically, you can get the update [here](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype-for-business/d85d8a57-0f61-4ff3-a0f4-444e131d8491).
