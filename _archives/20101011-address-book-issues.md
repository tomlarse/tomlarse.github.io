# Address book issues

I had a weird problem with an 2007R2 installation last week. The addressbook had stopped working. I checked all the normal errors, certificates and IIS on the FE, but everything seemed to be just fine. The addressbook files were created, and I could download all files in the browser. Everything seemed to be normal, except that the clients were giving the error about not being able to download the addressbook.
