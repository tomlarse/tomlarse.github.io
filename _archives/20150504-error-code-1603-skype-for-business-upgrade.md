# Error code 1603 - Skype for Business upgrade

Skype for Business server 2015 is here, and with it comes a time for "firsts". Today, I've done my first In-place upgrades on servers from Lync 2013 to SfB 2015.

**[Johan Svanborg](#4201 "2015-10-11 08:47:33"):** Did not need reboot. Just Close mentioned mmc-instances and Retry did it for me.

**[chucky12234](#4990 "2017-02-11 20:01:03"):** Same failure upgrading the Edge server. I had a Lync powershell window open. Closed it and hit retry and it was successful. Thanks for the blog post.

**[Mark](#4917 "2016-08-11 07:11:07"):** Just in case anyone else gets this error - there is something else I just experience ( only took 10 uninstalls and reinstalls before I looked in the log file )

**[EberD](#4939 "2016-10-05 18:29:44"):** For the error "Local Uninstalling the management services ... .Failed" with the error "OCSCore.msi MSI returned error code 1603.
