# Lync Meetings and Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format

One of the small things that make Lync Meetings so simple to join is that Outlook will recognize the meeting and wil give you a small button on the Outlook reminder that lets you join the meeting without even opening the calendar. This is also the same functionality that clickable from the calendar interface on the mobile and desktop clients and makes the meeting joinable from a Lync Room System.
