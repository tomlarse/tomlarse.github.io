<!--So I've been fiddling a bit with photos in Lync today. Seems easy enough when you have Exchange 2o10 and can use powershell, see this post, but can be more tricky if you haven't. Lync 2010 does not supply a method of uploading the pictures to AD, it just uses the photo found in the user attribute thumbnailPhoto. You'll have to upload the pictures another way.-->

# Photos in Lync 2010

So I've been fiddling a bit with photos in Lync today. Seems easy enough when you have Exchange 2o10 and can use powershell, see [this](http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2010/03/10/454223.aspx) post, but can be more tricky if you haven't. Lync 2010 does not supply a method of uploading the pictures to AD, it just uses the photo found in the user attribute **_thumbnailPhoto_**. You'll have to upload the pictures another way.

Howwever when i open Active Directory Users and Computers on that server there are no "employee" tab and no "photo" tabs either. i have set it for advanced view as well. what could be wrong???
