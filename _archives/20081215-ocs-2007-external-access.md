# OCS 2007 external access

When installing the OCS 2007 Enterprise pool/Standard edition front-end server, if you don't configure external user access at once (i.e. OCS is installed and only planned to be an internal service), the external urls for Address book, Live Meeting content and Group Expansion are not configurable from the GUI.  
  
They need to be configured from WMI or LCSCmd, ref
