# Communicator Phone Edition - Update Issues

After following several guides to configuring the device update service in OCS 2007 R2, including Rui Silvas [trilogy](http://blogs.technet.com/ucspotting/archive/2009/03/11/troubleshooting-ocs-2007-r2-device-update-service-for-communicator-phone-edition.aspx) and Rick Varvels [guide](http://blogs.technet.com/rickva/archive/2009/10/03/ocpe-device-tanjay-upgrade-guide.aspx), I still couldn't get the phones to update the software.
